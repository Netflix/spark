/**
 * An interface that defines how to write the data to data source in streaming queries.
 *
 * The writing procedure is:
 *   1. Create a writer factory by {@link #createStreamingWriterFactory()}, serialize and send it to
 *      all the partitions of the input data(RDD).
 *   2. For each epoch in each partition, create the data writer, and write the data of the epoch in
 *      the partition with this writer. If all the data are written successfully, call
 *      {@link DataWriter#commit()}. If exception happens during the writing, call
 *      {@link DataWriter#abort()}.
 *   3. If writers in all partitions of one epoch are successfully committed, call
 *      {@link #commit(long, WriterCommitMessage[])}. If some writers are aborted, or the job failed
 *      with an unknown reason, call {@link #abort(long, WriterCommitMessage[])}.
 *
 * While Spark will retry failed writing tasks, Spark won't retry failed writing jobs. Users should
 * do it manually in their Spark applications if they want to retry.
 *
 * Please refer to the documentation of commit/abort methods for detailed specifications.
